## AngularJS - MARS APP

View the deployed app through [Firebase] (https://mars-deployment.firebaseapp.com/)

### Summary:

A web-based singe-page app that uses AngularJS, Ajax, and CSS Animations.  
This app allows Mars colonists to register their information (name, age, and occupation)
and report alien encounters to which the data is stored and rendered in a different page.

1. Implement Ajax GET and POST requests using Angular $http service in order to accomplish the following functions:

- Save new colonist information and store it as data
- Report alien encounters as a registered colonist and store the reports as data
- Fetch stored report data and render it on a recent encounters page that refreshes as new information is submitted

2. Use Angular modules to create animation effects that display transition visuals between pages to pages.

### Web Development tools and methods used to build app:

- HTML /CSS
- AngularJS
- ngAnimate, ngCookies, ngTouch
- Flexbox
- Taskrunners such as Gulp, Autoprefixer, and BrowserSync
- SASS pre-compiler
- Firebase for deployment

### Personal Experience

This project's purpose was to solidify the concepts of AngularJS and practicing them.
There was minimal code and CSS partials involved but achieved numerous impressive functions, which made me fall in love with AngularJS.
This website felt more like an app than a static website and that felt really good developing it.
AngularJS was very challenging to learn and implement, I had to use extra resources online, teacher's suggestions,
and classmate aid but I came out learning a very cool language.  Moving forward I would love to implement more Angular as
I learn more and more.  Overall it was a great experience working on this web-app and using AngularJS.
